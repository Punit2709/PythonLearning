File handling is a crucial aspect of programming that involves performing operations on files, such as reading, writing, and modifying data stored in them. It allows programs to interact with files on a system, enabling data persistence beyond the runtime of the program. 
In most programming languages, file handling is facilitated by a set of built-in functions or libraries that provide a standardized way to open, read from, write to, and close files. When working with files, it is essential to handle exceptions or errors, such as a file not being found or permissions being denied, to ensure the program runs smoothly. 
Proper file handling is critical for tasks like logging, data processing, and managing configuration settings, making it a fundamental skill for developers.
